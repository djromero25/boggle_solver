Description:
This is a simple 4 X 4 boggle solver. You can enter your own game and find all the words.

The words list is taken from https://github.com/jacksonrayhamilton/wordlist-english

The current algorithm first reduces the word list to words that can be made with the letters shown, regardless of their positions on the board. Then with this reduced list, it goes through each word and checks if it can be reached according to Boggle's rules. This method is not fully optimized. It could be sped up further by removing checks for words that include a smaller word that couldn't be found already. An example of this is with the words 'red' and 'redirect'. If the word 'red' isn't there, then 'redirect' couldn't be there either. This could be fixed by converting the word list to a trie and allowing for entire sets of words to be removed from the check by knocking off one branch of the trie. The rest of the path check code could be used. All that would be needed is the initial trie conversion code and the branch removal check during the acceptance test for a smaller prefix word.
